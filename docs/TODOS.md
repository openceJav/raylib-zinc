## TODOs

This document serves as a central location for all tasks that need to be completed. As it is important
keep track of progress and tasks, this document will be updated regularly. The document is broken down
into the following sections:
1. **IN PROGRESS**: Tasks that are currently being worked on.
2. **BACKLOG**: Tasks that are not currently being worked on.
3. **DONE**: Tasks that have been completed or are near completion.
4. **ARCHIVED**: Tasks that are no longer relevant or have been replaced.

Each task should be formatted as follows:
```markdown
- [ ] MAIN TASK : DESCRIPTION
  - [ ] SUBTASK 1 : DESCRIPTION
  - [ ] SUBTASK 2 : DESCRIPTION
  - ...
```

Each task can be of the following states:
- open: `[ ]`
- done: `[x]`
- declined: `[-]`
- deleted: removed from the task list.

Tasks should also be assigned to people using the `@USERNAME` format, 
and tagged with any appropriate labels using the `#TAG` format.
